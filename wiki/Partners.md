# Partners

We're looking to work with companies and organizations that empower Creators and
Game Developers. We hope to offer through our activity new and exciting
opportunities to those people, and get them excited about this wonderful
industry.

Sickhouse is great. I've talked to them, and they seem interested in working
with us and even sponsoring us for future events. We hope that we'll get them
excited about GameDev at UTwente and we're looking to work with them and send
students to their in-person events, namely, Global Game Jam 2026.

## Gamelab Oost

GameLab Oost is also great. They we're one of the organizations we we're
screening for Inter-Actief Game Jam 2025. They said that they will look to fit
us in their sponsorship budget next year.

## TexTown Games

We got nothing from them yet. They seem very Dutch. Regardless, may be worth
looking into. Their offices are in Xior so they're very accessible.
